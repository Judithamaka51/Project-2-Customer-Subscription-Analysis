# Project-2-Customer-Subscription-Analysis
This project involves analysing customer data for a subscription service to identify  segments and trends. My goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types,  and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. The final deliverable is a Power BI  dashboard that presents my analysis.
